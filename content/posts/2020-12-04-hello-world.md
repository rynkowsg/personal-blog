Hello World, I'm Grzegorz, but you World, you can call me Greg.

### Who am I

I'm 31. Software developer by profession, problem solver and entrepreneur
by heart. Husband and father. Squash player, BJJ practitioner, occasionally
chess player. Lazy biohacker.

### Why yet another blog

You probably wonder why the hell the world needs yet another blog. Well, it
does. I believe even if the contribution is small and potentially insignificant,
at the scale of the globe it can make a difference to someone. Someone there is
going to say:

- _"I'm glad Greg put the effort of writing X down so I saved Y time"_

- _"Oh well I haven't thought about X that way"_

- _"Hah, if he can write blog, I can too and I bet I can do it better."_

Either way, I can say I make you World richer.
Moreover, it is truth even nobody read it...

### Even if nobody read it?

Yes, even if nobody read it. It's worth making it. For me, because I grow by
doing it, and for you World, because...
I'm growing by doing it, because if I grow, I become better so do you World.
It might sound ridiculous, but it is truth.

Imagine thanks to having blog I become better writer, become better programmer,
become better entrepreneur, and I create a second Linux, second Facebook,
you name it - we all become richer.

### How I grow

There are several dimensions of growth I see when writing blog:

#### learning how to write

I heard multiple times, that people nowadays lack three basic skills.

- how to speak - to defend their ideas, to sell products, to get other attention
- how to write - to be read, to formulate your ideas in the ordered manner
- how to listen - to listen thoroughly, listen actively, asking questions.

It may sound ridiculous, still if you think about it, you will agree.

Being honest with you, I think I can listen, although I think I've managed to
master it only in the few recent years.
I can't say the same about my writing nor my speaking.
I believe this blog will help me to improve my writing
and possibly it can lead me to improve my speaking in the future.

#### mastering various topics by teaching

When you learn something you absorb knowledge, and then you consolidate it.
They say you can learn by apply one or mix of three methods:

- studying _the topic_,
- building something involving _the topic_,
- teaching _the topic_.

The first is the most common and the least effective,
the last is the least common and the most effective.

It is all about absorption and consolidation of the knowledge.
You really need to understand something to be able to explain it.

#### building public image

There is no use of products or company if nobody hears about it.  It could be
the most wonderful thing, but it's useless if you haven't heard about it.
Same is with people. Without online presence, without personal marketing, I can
reach only a very narrow group of people I know. I want to change it.

Death of companies, ideas, products is inevitable, but without marketing,
they never really start their lives.
I don't know certainly whether this applies to people too, still life promoted
and noticed by many, might be more rewording than a life of anonymous, invisible
person.

### Final words

The decision has been made.

I'm going to share here my thoughts, my struggles, my doubts.

I'm going to explain here topics I study.

I'm going to boast here about my works.

I'm going to have my personal blog. Period.

Thanks for reading my first post World. See you later.
