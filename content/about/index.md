# About me

I studied software engineering (BEng) and for the circa last decade I've been working as a software engineer.

Non-professionally I try to stay fit & healthy, experimenting with various sports and activities.
Besides, I also try to invest savings intelligently and after hours build the next Facebook :)

Optimist. Life-long learner. Dreamer.
